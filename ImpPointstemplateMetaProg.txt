C++ Template MetaProgramming 
- It's a form of C++ programming
- Template Meta Programming (TMP) is turing complete functional programming language built-in to C++.
- TMP variables are always immutable 
- TMP doesn't have loops , so we use recursion.
-TMP doesn't have branching , So we use specialization.

Loki : - It is one of the oldest C++ MetaProgramming library
Boost.MPL - It is header only C++03 base library. general purpose Template MetaProgramming framework
            of compile time algorithms , containers , sequences and metafunctions.
Boost.Fusion - It's a library for working with heterogeneous collection of data ,
                commonly refered to as tuples
Boost.Hana - calls itself your standard library for MetaProgramming.
            It's header only and provides a super set of the features in Boost.MPL and Boost.Fusion
Boost.HOF (Higher Order Functions) - is a recent addition to the Boost Family.
        like Hana, it's a header only C++11 and C++14 library, provides utility functions and functions objects.

Boost.Hana : It's recently addition to Boost library.
- Superset of the Boost.MPL and Boost.Fusion libraries
- provides  library support for tuples , also known as heterogeneous collections.
- It also has large number of functional methods
