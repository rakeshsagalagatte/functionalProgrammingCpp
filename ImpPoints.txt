### Map, Filter and Reduce 
- Map , Filter and Reduce don't exist in C++, But Alternative Does,
- std::transform replaces Map
- std::copy_if replaces Filter
- std::accumulate replaces Reduce

what is lambda function?
  - Lambda comes from the Lambda Calculus and refers to anonymous functions in programming.

Why is this cool? 
  - It allows you to write quick throw away functions without naming them. It also provides a nice way to write closures.

Partial application is a techniq in functional programming,
which creates a new fuction with smaller number of arguments from an old one ,
The number of arguments this function accepts is called arity. 
 std::bind is used for this
 - Manipulate a funtion and it's parameter
 - reorder the function's arguments
 - And, Bind values to arbitary arguments

###########################
std::function is a wrapper for invokable objects
- invokable objects include functions , functors , and lambdas 
- We can store functions in objects like vectors 
* invocation operator -> The function call operator () can be overloaded for objects of class type. When you overload ( ), 
                         you are not creating a new way to call a function. Rather, you are creating an operator function
                         that can be passed an arbitrary number of parameters.
