- Combines the best parts: of the Observer and Iterator patterns and Functional programming
- It abstracts away dirty details and leaves fewer lines of more powerful code.
- ReactiveX is important and available for all major programming languages including C++.
- Used by many top tech companies.
- It's running in frontend , backend , mobile and desktop apps . 

The 4 main components of ReactiveX are :
1. Observables - which are composable streams of events.
2. Observers - are those interested in those events.
3. Operators - which are functions that manipulate Observables.
4. Schedulers - that execute actions associated with Operators.
